;;;; FILE: set.lisp
;;;; BRIEF: basic operations for finite sets
;;;; AUTHOR: Neil T. Dantam
;;;;
;;;; Common Lisp includes set operations for finite sets represented
;;;; as lists, however these may become slow as sets grow very large.
;;;; Thus, we abstract the set operations to allow for easy
;;;; replacement of underlying representation with something like hash
;;;; tables, search trees, or bit vectors later.
